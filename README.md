# Detroit Labs Weather App

A basic weather app for technical interview with Detroit Labs. This app was built with SwiftUI and has an MVVM architecture with Combine.

## Setup

Clone and open with Xcode 12.0 or later (built with Xcode 13 beta).

Obtain API keys from [OpenWeather](https://home.openweathermap.org). Copy `Config/Debug.xcconfig.sample` and rename to `Config/Debug.xcconfig`. Add API keys to file. Repeat for `Config/Release.xcconfig` (not required for development).

Build and run :)
